"""
common/weapon.py — the one weapon concept both worlds share (POC design sec 9).

POC §9 left an open question: "Bane's ``StaffState`` becomes a gun; outdoor
already has bullet logic. Reconcile into one weapon concept or keep per-world."
This module is the reconciliation. A **weapon** is a *projectile spec* plus a
*fire-control*, and a player carries a *loadout* of them. The outdoor shell
cannon and (later) the interior's staff-as-gun are then the SAME concept with
different specs and controls — not two firing code paths.

What a weapon is
----------------
  - ``ProjectileSpec`` — the round's shape and physics: model, speed, range,
    scale, hit radius, spawn offset, fly height. Pure data; no engine type.
  - ``FireControl`` — the *gate*: given the trigger and the live battlefield,
    decide whether a round is emitted this tick, and own any cooldown clock.
    ``BallisticFireControl`` is the canonical Battlezone gate (one live round
    of your own on screen at a time). A cadence/heat control for a rapid-fire
    weapon is a second implementation that slots in beside it — its economy
    (unlimited / finite ammo / heat) is a gameplay decision, deferred here.
  - ``Weapon`` — binds a spec to a control and knows the firing *geometry*
    (spawn ahead of the shooter along its forward vector, inherit heading).
  - ``Loadout`` — the list of weapons + the active index, with select/cycle.
    Input *binding* (number keys vs a cycle key) is a shell concern and is
    intentionally NOT wired here.

Why this lives in ``common/`` and stays engine-neutral
------------------------------------------------------
Like ``model``, ``motion``, and ``spatial``, this module imports nothing from
either engine, so both worlds can depend on it without either depending on the
other. It never constructs an engine-specific projectile itself; instead each
world injects a ``ProjectileFactory`` that builds its own projectile type (the
outdoor world supplies a BZ ``Bullet`` factory; a future indoor weapon supplies
a Bane ``Projectile`` factory). The ``battlefield`` and ``shooter`` arguments
are duck-typed — the control reads ``battlefield.bullets`` (each with an
``owner``) and the geometry reads ``shooter.forward`` / ``.x`` / ``.z`` /
``.heading`` — so no concrete class crosses the seam.

Pure logic + small dataclasses. No GL, no Qt, no engine imports.

    Why per-shooter (Session 7, vision §7): the player is a single shooter, so
    ``cap = 1`` reproduces the arcade one-shell rule exactly. But every enemy
    tank is its own shooter, so a six-tank field can have up to six rounds in
    flight (one each) — the war reads as a war instead of the whole field
    politely sharing one bullet. The per-shooter ``cap`` is what keeps that

    per-shooter attribution *with* a per-shooter cap, not an ungated field.

    Stateless: the gate is read entirely from the live ``battlefield.bullets``
    (each tagged with its ``shooter``), so it needs no clock. When no shooter is
